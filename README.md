## AvidCoder's To-do List!

### Hi all! This is a To-do list that I have created that is still being developed on. Feel free to use it! Some things that I am still working on and you need to be aware of :

### 1. I still need to make sure that it saves tasks when the page is closed
### 2. I still need to make sure that it saves tasks when the page is reloaded.

### Feel free to contribute as I would really appreciate it ðŸ˜Š

### If you like this repo, please give it a ðŸŒŸ. Thanks!
